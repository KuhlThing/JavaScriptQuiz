# JavaScriptQuiz

This is a simple (if esoteric) quiz, as I couldn't get a timer to work, couldn't figure out localStorage, and don't know enough about JavaScript to write trivia on it. It's been a very rough week, which I know isn't an excuse for a program like this, but it's all I've got. I've been in physical, mental, and emotional pain since before the break. It has proven difficult for me to retain any knowledge in JavaScript, but I think I am finally making progress. Too little, too late for this assignment though. 

The quiz is easy enough to use. It begins on page load. The user just clicks the answer, and the page moves on to the next question. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is displayed.
